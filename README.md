# ðŸ¥— BiteRight â€“ Food Ingredient Risk & Nutrition Dashboard  

**BiteRight is my personal project that I use very often** to quickly analyze packaged food products I buy and consume.  
Itâ€™s built in [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io) and designed to be both practical for everyday use

BiteRight is a Streamlit web app that helps you analyze packaged food products.  
It pulls nutrition and ingredient data (e.g. from OpenFoodFacts), and displays them in a clean, color-coded dashboard highlighting:

- ðŸ“¦ Serving size  
- âš¡ Macros (energy, carbs, sugars, protein, fat, etc.)  
- ðŸ’Š Micros (vitamins & minerals)  
- ðŸŒ¿ Ingredients with risk levels (High / Moderate / Low / Unknown)  

The app uses a harmful ingredient risk list CSV to highlight unsafe additives and show why they might be harmful.  
It also supports a custom **Daily Values CSV** to calculate **%DV (percent of daily value)** for macros like sugars, fat, saturated fat, and sodium.
