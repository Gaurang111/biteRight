# 🥗 BiteRight – Food Ingredient Risk & Nutrition Dashboard

**BiteRight** is a Streamlit web app that helps you analyze packaged food products.  
It pulls nutrition and ingredient data (e.g. from OpenFoodFacts), and displays them in a **clean, color-coded dashboard** highlighting:

- 📦 **Serving size**  
- ⚡ **Macros** (energy, carbs, sugars, protein, fat, etc.)  
- 💊 **Micros** (vitamins & minerals)  
- 🌿 **Ingredients** with **risk levels** (High / Moderate / Low / Unknown)  

The app uses a **harmful ingredient risk list** CSV to highlight unsafe additives and show why they might be harmful.
